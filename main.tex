``Work.'' The parties hereto agree as follows: 


\section{Services}

What is the agreement about?


\section{Vision statement}

Shortly state what we want to achieve with the validation service and our personal goals. This is not binding but should give both parties an idea what to achieve and is a good place to come back to when critical choices for future operations must be done.

\subsection{Critical Events}
Slashing: share costs 50:50 not relevant who caused the issue
What else?



\subsection{Compensation and Payment}

All payouts are split 50:50

\subsection{Costs of operation}

All costs are shared 50:50

\subsection{Capital provision}

Ideally self-stake is provided 50:50

\section{Contract Length and Availability}

No contact length, until cancelled

\section{Termination}

Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving 30 days written notice
to the other of such termination. 

The party who wants to quit the agreement needs to give the other party a chance to overtake the full operation. This includes paying out the stake, overtaking the infrastructure etc.

\section{Confidentiality}

Both parties hold the private keys to all on-chain accounts (validator keys and keys to the on-chain identity). No party is allowed to share those keys with any third-party at any given time.
